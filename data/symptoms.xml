<h2>Mercury Poisoning: Symptoms and Diseases</h2>
<p>Mercury is the most poisonous,non-radioactive, naturally occurring substance on our planet. Thereis no safe level of mercury because even one atom of it in yourbody is doing some harm to it. There is no debate about thetoxicity of mercury and every knowledgeable scientist and healthprofessional understands how poisonous mercury is. Yet even todaythe American Dental Association (ADA) and pro-amalgam dentists whosupport its insane, logic defying position, continue to say thatthe mercury released from these fillings is not a healthhazard.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) hasstated that there is no safe level of mercury. That means that noamount of mercury is safe, not even one atom. Even if enoughmercury hasn't accumulated to manifest a symptom directly orindirectly related to chronic mercury poisoning, it doesn't meanyou are not being poisoned by it. The straw that broke theproverbial camel's back wasn't the last straw, it was the sum totalof the weight of all of the straws.</p>
<p>The fact is that mercury can directly orindirectly cause, contribute to, or make worse every health issuewe will ever deal with. Chronic mercury poisoning from amalgamfillings takes time to accumulate and express a related symptom.Because mercury is found in every cell of the body, and there aretrillions of cells, it may take years for enough mercury toaccumulate for a symptom to appear. Chronic mercury poisoning isnot a disease but an accumulative problem and during the period oftime it is accumulating it is poisoning you every step along theway.</p>
<p>I find it very ironic that regulatoryagencies require that the materials that make up an amalgamfilling, such as mercury, silver, zinc, copper and tin, must beplaced in a hazardous waste container when enters the dentaloffice. The old amalgam filling pieces that are removed from atooth must also be placed in an hazardous waste container. Yetthere is no regulation of an amalgam filling when it's placed in atooth! Isn't it logical that because amalgam material is in thetooth that it also makes the tooth a hazardous waste container.</p>
<p>It's a scientific fact that toxic mercuryvapor is continually being released from amalgam fillings. 80% ofit enters the body and accumulates in it. This accumulation occursbecause overtime the body loses its effectiveness at removingmercury and is less and less effective at doing so. If mercury isstored in your body it also makes it a hazardous waste container.So don't be fooled by the ADA and those who support its position onmercury amalgam fillings. Mercury is continuously released fromamalgam fillings and that alone makes them a health hazard. Youshouldn't be the same house with mercury vapor, let alone having itbeing released from your fillings.</p>
<p>For more information about how mercuryaffects the body and how it does its damage I suggest reading
<a href="../browse/poisonfillings.html">The Poison in Your Teeth:Mercury Amalgam (Silver) Fillings . . . Hazardous to YourHealth</a>. Another book of value,
<a href="../browse/guide.html">Mercury Detoxification: The Natural Way toRemove Mercury from Your Body</a>, tells you how to support yourbody's efforts to safely remove the stored mercury. Once you learnhow devastating it is your health you will be dumbfounded as to howthe ADA can possibly continue to support the use of this poisonousmaterial</p>
<h2>Symptoms Related to MercuryPoisoning</h2>
<p>At least 100symptoms directly or indirectly result from chronic mercurypoisoning. The number and severity of symptoms depend on a varietyof factors, such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>how many fillings you have;</li>
<li>how long you've had them;</li>
<li>how they are stimulated; and</li>
<li>how often they are stimulated.</li></ul>
<p>In addition, because mercury is classified as a neurotoxin itcan also cause or contribute to emotional and psychological issues,such as depression, anxiety, mood swings and memory loss. Symptomsthat worsen over time may signal the development of adisease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This table lists some of the more common symptoms directlyrelated to chronic mercury toxicity.&nbsp;But keep in mind thatbecause mercury can indirectly cause harm by depleting essentialantioxidants, such as glutathione and alpha lipoic acid that areneeded to remove it and deal with other harmful toxins and freeradicals, it can indirectly be contributing to even more symptomsand diseases than are listed here.</p>

<h4>Other Factors</h4>
<p>When it comes toestablishing the causative link between mercury and disease, it’simportant to consider other factors that can produce similarsymptoms, including genetics, diet, lifestyle, environment,occupation, and substance abuse, either alone or in conjunctionwith each other. But the possibility of developing a related healthproblem dramatically increases when these factors
<i>and</i>mercury are present together.

<h4>Mercury Detoxification</h4>
<p>If you have, or had, mercury amalgam(silver) fillings the chances are that you are mercury toxic tosome degree. If you have any of the related symptoms or diseases,are subject to multiple allergies, and have a depleted immunesystem, I believe it is critical to participate in a safe andeffective mercury detoxification program.

<strong>
<a href="../browse/guide.html">Mercury Detoxification: The Natural Way toRemove Mercury from Your Body</a></strong> will guide you throughevery step of the mercury detoxification process.</p>
